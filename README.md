# QuickESG

Streamlit app to quickly visualise a company's Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating over time, within its industry, and against other companies. Work in progress.

It always frustrated me to dig around the web for free time series data on ESG scores, hence this app's existence. I also wanted to test out Streamlit and Altair.
